# Problem:
  Binary Tree Maximum Path Sum
  
  Given a binary tree, find the maximum path sum.

  For this problem, a path is defined as any sequence of nodes from some starting node to any node in the tree along the parent-child connections. The path does not need to go through the root.

  For example:
  Given the below binary tree,

       1
      / \
     2   3

  Return 6.
