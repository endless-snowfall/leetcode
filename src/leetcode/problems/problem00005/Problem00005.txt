Problem:
    ZigZag Conversion

    The string "PAYPALISHIRING" is written in a zigzag pattern on a given number of rows like this:
    (you may want to display this pattern in a fixed font for better legibility)

    P   A   H   N
    A P L S I I G
    Y   I   R
    
    And then read line by line: "PAHNAPLSIIGYIR"
    Write the code that will take a string and make this conversion given a number of rows:
    
    string convert(string text, int nRows);
    convert("PAYPALISHIRING", 3) should return "PAHNAPLSIIGYIR".

Clarifications:
    - What kind of characters will I encounter?
    - Is there is maximum length?
    - Will there be null or empty input?
    - Will there be nonsensical invocations?

Approach:
    - Use a StringBuilder for each row that we're building.
    - Create an array to mark each character's index with the row that it belongs to.
    - When iterating the input characters and populating the array, we need to oscillate between
        row 1 and row nRows in the following fashion:
            (1) If we hit 1 then we need to go up after.
            (2) If we hit nRows then we need to go down after.

Runtime Analysis:
    Definitions:
        n is the length of the input string.
        
    Breakdown:
        - O(n) to parse the input in a single pass.
        - O(n) for the array that we'll use to hold the index assignment.
        - O(nRows) to store nRows StringBuilders, holding O(n) characters.
        - There is a "pyramid" distribution to how many characters we will anticipate in each row's
            StringBuilder.
        
    Overall:
        Space: O(n) + O(n) = O(n)
        Time: O(n) + O(n) = O(n)

Notes:
    - There are many edge cases concerning the length of the input, and the provided numRows which
        should lead to either:
            (1) Returning an empty result, or
            (2) Returning the original input
