Problem:
    Container With Most Water
    
    Given n non-negative integers a1, a2, ..., an, where each represents a point at coordinate (i, ai).
    n vertical lines are drawn such that the two endpoints of line i is at (i, ai) and (i, 0).
    Find two lines, which together with x-axis forms a container, such that the container contains the most water.

    Note: You may not slant the container.
    
Clarifications:
    - How many heights to expect?
    - Range of height values?
    - Are negatives possible?

Approach:
    - Two maps to hold height -> index values.
    - First to hold left-most indices, second to hold right-most indices.
    - Update second map when encountering new y values.
    - Consider pairs only.
        
Runtime Analysis:
    Definitions:
        x is length of input array.
        n is number of distinct heights in input.
        m is number of n that have at least a paired occurrence.
        
    Breakdown:
        - O(n) space for first map.
        - O(m) space for second map.
        - O(1) for candidate result.
        - O(x) to process input of x points.
        - O(n) to process maps for result.
        
    Overall:
        Space: O(n + m)
        Time: O(n)
