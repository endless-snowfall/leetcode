# Problem:
  
  Binary Tree Preorder Traversal
  
  Given a binary tree, return the preorder traversal of its nodes' values.

  For example: Given binary tree {1,#,2,3},
  
   1
    \
     2
    /
   3
   
  return [1,2,3].

  Note: Recursive solution is trivial, could you do it iteratively?
  
# Clarifications:
  - Is null input valid? -> Assume yes and the result is an empty list.

# Approach:
## Approach (1): [Recursive]
  - Basic recursive approach.

## Approach (2): [Iterative]
  - Breaking bonds.
  
# Runtime Analysis:
##Definitions:
  - n is the number of nodes in the tree.

##Recursive:
  - Space: None
  - Time: O(n)
