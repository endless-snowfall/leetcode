# Problem:
  Add Digits
  
  Given a non-negative integer num, repeatedly add all its digits until the result has only one digit.

  For example:

  Given num = 38, the process is like: 3 + 8 = 11, 1 + 1 = 2. Since 2 has only one digit, return it.

  Follow up:
  Could you do it without any loop/recursion in O(1) runtime?
  
# Clarifications:
  - Can n be negative or zero? -> Assume no.

# Approach:
  - We want one loop to terminate when the number is less than 10.
  - We want another loop to sum the digits and then make that our "new" number.
