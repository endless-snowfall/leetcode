# Problem:
  Combination Sum II
  
  Given a collection of candidate numbers (C) and a target number (T), find all unique combinations in C where the candidate numbers sums to T.
  Each number in C may only be used once in the combination.

  Note:
  All numbers (including target) will be positive integers.
  Elements in a combination (a1, a2, … , ak) must be in non-descending order. (ie, a1 ≤ a2 ≤ … ≤ ak).
  The solution set must not contain duplicate combinations.
  
  For example, given candidate set 10,1,2,7,6,1,5 and target 8, 
  A solution set is: 
  [1, 7] 
  [1, 2, 5] 
  [2, 6] 
  [1, 1, 6] 
  
# Clarifications:
  - Similar to Problem 39.

# Approach:
  - Similar to Problem 39 aside from the following differences:
    - (1) Since we can only use each element once, we won't need to loop for each time we could use a particular element.
    - (2) The tricky thing is to avoid duplicate sets.  For example, if we have a contiguous sequence of 1's we only want to "process" the first 1 because the recursion will consider the other 1's.  After that recursion finishes we will want to skip over all the 1's until we arrive at a new number.  This is the important step to avoid duplicate combinations.
